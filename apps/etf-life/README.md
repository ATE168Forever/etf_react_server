# ETF Life (apps/etf-life)

This package contains the original ETF Life React + Vite application. Install dependencies from the repository root and then run the package scripts via pnpm workspaces.

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life dev
pnpm --filter etf-life build
pnpm --filter etf-life lint
pnpm --filter etf-life test
```

## Unit tests

Jest powers the ETF Life unit tests. Run the entire suite locally with:

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life test
```

To focus on the auto-save coverage that verifies CSV, Google Drive, OneDrive, and iCloud Drive behaviour, target the specific suite:

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life test -- InventoryAutoSave.test.jsx
```

Codex does not run Jest automaticallyâ€”you should execute the tests yourself before sending changes for review so that regressions are caught early.

If you prefer to rely on automation, the repository ships with a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It installs dependencies with pnpm and runs `pnpm --filter etf-life test` on every pull request targeting `main`.

## Docker image

To build and run the production image the Dockerfile also installs dependencies from the lockfile:

```bash
cd apps/etf-life
docker build -t etf-view .
docker run -p 3000:80 etf-view
```

Rebuild the image whenever dependencies change so the container has the correct `node_modules`.

## OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud Drive Backup

Environment variable documentation for the various backup providers lives inside the source files and comments. Set the values in a `.env` file at the package root so Vite exposes them to the client at build time.
