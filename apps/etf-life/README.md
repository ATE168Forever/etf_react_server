# ETF Life (apps/etf-life)

This package contains the original ETF Life React + Vite application. Install dependencies from the repository root and then run the package scripts via pnpm workspaces.

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life dev
pnpm --filter etf-life build
pnpm --filter etf-life lint
pnpm --filter etf-life test
```

## Unit tests

Jest powers the ETF Life unit tests. Run the entire suite locally with:

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life test
```

To focus on the auto-save coverage that verifies CSV, Google Drive, OneDrive, and iCloud Drive behaviour, target the specific suite:

```bash
pnpm --filter etf-life test -- InventoryAutoSave.test.jsx
```

Codex does not run Jest automaticallyâ€”you should execute the tests yourself before sending changes for review so that regressions are caught early.

If you prefer to rely on automation, the repository ships with a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It installs dependencies with pnpm and runs `pnpm --filter etf-life test` on every pull request targeting `main`.

## Docker image

To build and run the production image the Dockerfile also installs dependencies from the lockfile:

```bash
cd apps/etf-life
docker build -t etf-view .
docker run -p 3000:80 etf-view
```

Rebuild the image whenever dependencies change so the container has the correct `node_modules`.

## Firebase realtime sync

The inventory screen now supports realtime backup via Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) and Cloud Firestore. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or your preferred Vite environment file) inside `apps/etf-life/` and fill in the Firebase values before running the app:

```
cp apps/etf-life/.env.example apps/etf-life/.env
```

Then edit the file and paste the values from your Firebase web app configuration. When you register the web app, Firebase shows a snippet similar to:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'AIza...your-api-key',
  authDomain: 'your-project.firebaseapp.com',
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  storageBucket: 'your-project.appspot.com',
  messagingSenderId: '1234567890',
  appId: '1:1234567890:web:abcdef',
  measurementId: 'G-XXXXXXX' // optional
};
```

Map each entry to the matching environment variable in `.env`:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef
# Optional: only if you enabled Google Analytics for this Firebase project
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXX
```

Only one Firebase project is required for each deployment environment. Maintainers (or anyone self-hosting the app) should create the project, enable Google sign-in and Cloud Firestore, and then share the above configuration values with the build or deployment pipeline. End users simply sign in with Google; they do **not** need to provision their own Firebase project or API key.

Each workspace is stored at `workspaces/{uid}` with `updatedAt` managed by `serverTimestamp`. IndexedDB persistence is enabled for offline support. Deploy `apps/etf-life/firestore.rules` so only the authenticated owner can read or write the workspace document.

## OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud Drive Backup

Environment variable documentation for the various backup providers lives inside the source files and comments. Set the values in a `.env` file at the package root so Vite exposes them to the client at build time.
